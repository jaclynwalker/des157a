            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                Observing imagery is a great way to practice visual and critical thinking skills. Complex, intriguing imagery, with context that is not always clear, encourages the viewer to observe deeper and look for more details in order to make sense of the image. Often, deciphering a complex image is rewarding for the viewer because it allows them to think like a detective and create a meaning that makes sense to them. These kinds of “what’s going on?” images introduce viewers to new ideas, allowing them to try new observational approaches and encouraging them to pay attention to details.

                A website I believe uses imagery in an engaging way is Unseen Studios. This website allows the user to interact with the images, producing a wide variety of animations based on where the user hovers their mouse. The images are abstract and encourage the viewer to further explore what they are looking at by hovering over more locations, scrolling, and clicking.

            <h2>Best Practices for Modal Design</h2>
            <p>
                Modals are a great tool for simplifying user interface and saving screen space. They are a useful tool for getting user information or displaying additional information. However, the overuse of modals has caused users to instinctively avoid modals by automatically dismissing them whenever they pop up. An important way to make modals user-friendly is by letting the users’ actions trigger the modal, as surprise modals may trigger the user to automatically close them. It is also important to always give the user a clear path to escape a modal. This can be done with exit buttons, escape options, cancel buttons, or letting the user click outside the modal. Another important part of modal design is giving the modal a descriptive title so the purpose of the modal is made clear. It is also important to size modals properly according to the size of the window. This article recommends that a modal should not be larger than 50% of the window space. It is also helpful to darken the background of the page to make the modal stand out. Modals also do not work well on mobile because of the small screen size.

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <p>
                The main best practice for form design is keeping the form as simple as possible; "less is more." It is important that forms accommodate the user, since most people do not enjoy filling out forms. Creating an experience for the user that is as straight forward as possible will encourage users to complete form fields. Forms should have a simple layout that allow the user to view the entire form before completion. This can be done buy putting the form into a single column layout. It is also important to put the easier questions first and to clearly distinguish the required and optional fields from each other. Adding labels to and sizing input fields accordingly can also help guide the user.

                One form I believe is user friendly is the Aritzia create an account form. The information is organized into a column from the most to least simple inputs, everything is labeled, and is is made clear which parts are optional and which are required.
