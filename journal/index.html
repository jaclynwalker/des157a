            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <p>
                The main best practice for form design is keeping the form as simple as possible; "less is more." It is important that forms accommodate the user, since most people do not enjoy filling out forms. Creating an experience for the user that is as straight forward as possible will encourage users to complete form fields. Forms should have a simple layout that allow the user to view the entire form before completion. This can be done buy putting the form into a single column layout. It is also important to put the easier questions first and to clearly distinguish the required and optional fields from each other. Adding labels to and sizing input fields accordingly can also help guide the user.

                One form i believe is user friendly is the Aritzia create an account form. The information is organized into a column from the most to least simple inputs, everything is labeled, and is is made clear which parts are optional and which are required.
