    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The layout is straightforward and it is easy to navigate and view the overlays.</li>
        <li>The slideshows are easy to click through because the buttons are very obvious</li>
        <li>The location tags are not very visible. They are also not easy to use because the instructions are unclear.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Plan</h3>
    <p>I want to make my locationm tags more visibile. I want to try adding borders around them so they stand out more from the image. I also will move them around to a location where they don't blend in with the background image. I also want to add markers to my slideshows to the user knows which sldie tey are viewing so they dont accidentally view the slideshow three times through.</p>
