    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <p>I want to iterate my every picture project. My every picture project currently allows the user to click on a cut-out image on my dog Bella. Then a pop-up is revealed showing the full image with a description of the image content. I want to improve the visual design, as well as add more image interactions and animations. I want to add more exciting design elements into my project so there is more for the user to engage with. I want to do this by creating a new background, creating more hover animations, utilizing timer animation, making the page more user friendly with better visual design, incorporating slideshows , and creating fun hidden location information.</p>

    <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
    <p>I want to add a background illustration to my page. I currently just have a plain pink background. I like the pink color scheme but I think the page would look more interesting with a simple landscape illustration or with an interesting gradient. I also want to utilize purple lines and borders as a theme within muy design. I also want to make my color scheme more cohesive. I want to make all the foreground, background, text, and button colors correspond together better. I also want to darken the background when an overlay pops-up so the user can focus on the overlay better.</p>

    <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
    <p>I want to add image slideshows to my overlays. For example, when the user opens the “Bella is at the beach” overlay, they can view multiple different images of Bella at different beaches with different angles and poses. I plan to make these sliders time based, but I also want to allow the user to click through them as they please. I also want to try adding a location tag on certain photos. When the user hovers over the tag, the location the image was taken at shows. I also want to add more animations to my page. Right now, I have a scale animation when the user hovers over a cutout image on the main page. I think incorporating more hover animations would encourage the user to click through the page more. I also think incorporating a time-based animation would make the page more engaging. I also want to try adding an animated border when the image is hovered over by displaying a gif.</p>

    <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
    <p>I want to add more content to the page to make it more engaging. Right now, the design is very simple and straightforward. I believe creating more interactive elements like slideshows and location tags, and visual elements such as animations will make the page a more memorable experience, where the user can do more than simply clicking through pop ups. I want to incorporate a stronger design theme as well in order to create a better user experience. By creating a design theme based around the purple border color scheme, the user will be able to better understand the visual hierarchy of the page. </p>
